# Becoming An Effective Contributor To Swift

## AppBuilders CH, 2018

## Abstract

The Swift community is full of passionate, intelligent developers who love the language 
that they use.  Many would love to be able to contribute, but encounter hurdles such as
the inability to establish an effective workflow, lack of documentation around tips and
tricks, and unexpected interactions between the compiler and its tools.  This presentation 
is an effort to change that; to provide a central place where eager contributors can pick up
and get going with the Swift project quickly and easily.
